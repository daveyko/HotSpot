Disagrements: For simple diagrements we will vote.  For more complex ones, we will have a discussion.

Frustration: "OIPEN" - dialog safe word.  Nothing is personal, we are all trying to learn and build cool stuff, even though it may get stressful sometimes.

Merging: Pull request with working code.  One person must review the request before merging.

Asking for help: Take roughly 15 minutes.  Try docs and google, but dont get stuck for too long.

Pairing: Start of pairing, with the possiblity of changing that later.  Switch at natural stopping points, try not to go over an hour in one role.

After hours: Working after hours is okay, but make sure to communicate.  We can revise this as deadlines approach.

Stand ups: In the morning!



stay coooool ;)
